        <p>Hi I'm Aaron, I've been studying web development on and off for the past 6 months by following tutorials from MDN, treehouse, Udemy, and other online resources. To help gain a better understanding and completely immerse myself in web development I signed up to NYCDA. I am 28 years old and have had a lot of different jobs in the past but am working on getting my foot in the door of web development. My goal is to become a developer and increase my skills so that I can get into freelancing. </p>
